        <h2 class="historyH2"> The Grim Reapers: 1937-1961</h2>
        <div class="historyphotoholder1">
        </div>
      <p class="historytext">
        In their early days, Disney prioritized character design and vocal performance over character development and it showed through the early collection of villains, this shows through the shallowness of their goals, like wanting to be the most beautiful or not being invited to a christening party. Though they're reasons were small and may be considered petty, their murderous intent shows just how evil these characters were through their willingness to go to such extreme lengths over virtually nothing... those poor damsels.</p>

        <h2 class="historyH2">The Sleezy Villain: 1963-1988</h2>
        <div class="historyphotoholder2">
        </div>
        <p class="historytext">This is a period of greed for Disney Villains as they all seemed driven by excess. With characters like Edgar Balthazar from the Aristocats who wanted the widow's inheritance, to King John from Robin Hood who wanted immense power and wealth, and even Shere Khan from The Jungle Book whose wish was to kill all humans; all of these anti-heroes shared a common trait, greed. During this era, Americans were experiencing inflation and a rise of unemployment, causing lots of stress and anxiety in the people during that time. As a reflection, cartoons used villains to showcase the greed of corporations which caused viewers to have more sympathy for the antagonist in these films.</p>
        <h2 class="historyH2">A Flair For The Dramatics: 1989-2009</h2>
        <div class="historyphotoholder3">
        </div>
        <p class="historytext">While we are still in a period of greed with our villains but there is a shift in the styling. There everyday figure of the villains from the sleezy era are combined with the dramatic elements of the traditional villains in during the grim reapers' era. We see characters like Ursula, from the little mermaid, who is a bold and rambunctious villain rise and take over the world by storm. The color palettes grow darker, and the voices become more menacing. Unlike the previous villains mentioned, these characters are on a search for power making them seem more ambitious. What makes these power-hungry villains differ from the ones during the reaper phase is that there is more backstory on these fiends showing their motivations behind their wants. This reflects society's interest in the villains and their backstories making them seem more human and, dare I say it, relatable.</p>
        <h2 class="historyH2">Villains In Disguise: 2010-current</h2>
        <div class="historyphotoholder4">
        </div>
        <p class="historytext">Straying again from the previous style of villain, we are presented with a new era of villains. These dubious fiends are the plotters, the ones who seem normal at first and then change drastically once their true motives are revealed. Though physically they are represented as everyday people, their mannerism and demeanors take a turn once they showcase their true colors. These villains have varying motivations ranging from wants in power, money, jealousy, revenge, etc... the only common trait that these characters possess is the fact their two-faced nature and their backstory. The humanization on villains continues into this era of villains but their evil nature comes into play through deception. This form of villain reflects on the internal threats and dangers of everyday people during a time where America is faced with an increase of hate crimes.</p>
