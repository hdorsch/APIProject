        Disney has spent the past one hundred and one years imagining up and
        creating complex villains that explore a range of different situations
        and lessons. These villains help bring forth the plots of these movies
        and give the audience someone to root against while exploring the ideas
        as to why the act the way that they do.

        The evolution of Disney villains over the years has given us villains of
        different and diverse backgrounds. Places such as Europe, Mongolia,
        America, and the islands of Polynesia have all given us different
        villains with different motivaitons.Disney has always had a strong sense
        of uniquiness within all of their villains, which has been highlighted
        in recent years

        Disney villains have long since been used to explore complex topics
        ranging from the harmful effects of jealousy and envy to rejection and
        exclusion due to differences. Disney has been using their villains as
        vessles for these complex topics since their inception. Many point to
        the hero's for these complex lessons, but in truth, many great lessons
        can be learned from the villains.
