          <h2>The Hays Code</h2>
  
          <p>
            The vast majority of early Disney villains are often portrayed the way they are as a result of the Hays Code. The Hays Code was a set of self-censorship guidelines the film industry adhered to in order to avoid legal scrutiny from state and federal regulations over what content was allowed or forbidden in films of that era. The basics of the Hays Code was that you could not promote anything that would be considered violent, deviant, or offensive, including but not limited to crime, homosexuality, profanity, interracial relationships, etc.

            However, these traits would be included in a film provided that they are condemned. As a result, many Disney villains were often queer-coded, meaning they were often implied to be queer or lightly portrayed as queer, either to give at least some representaiton to these groups or to actively comdemn these traits by attaching them to villains. This is why characters like Scar or Hades are represented somewhat flamboyantly, or at least explicitly less masculine than other male characters in their respective films, or why Ursula was designed with elements often seen in drag queens.

            The Hays Code was first adopted in around 1930 and was later dropped in 1966. The Hays Code was controversal through its entire adoption period, with different factions trying to enforce, loosen, or outright abolish the code. While many agreed that, as a medium with substantial influence, films should be careful with said influence as to not promote harmful moral character, others brought up how the Hays Code actively suppressed more potentially thought-provoking films or comdemned minority groups which were not nearly as harmful as they were portrayed. As the Hays Code started to become less and less enforcable, it was eventually dropped.
